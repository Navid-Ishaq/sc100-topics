# SC-100 Topic 1

Design a security strategy to support business resiliency goals, including identifying and prioritizing threats to business-critical assets

# 🔐 The Fortress of Resilience  

**SC-100 Topic 1**

## 🌍 Scenario  
At **Resilio Dynamics**, storms of uncertainty shook the boardroom. Cyber threats lurked like shadows, and the executives turned to their IT security council:  

*"How do we build a security strategy strong enough to protect what matters most — and keep the business alive when the storm comes?"*  

🗝️ **I.K. – The Invisible Key** whispered from the silence:  
*"Resilience is not the absence of storms, but the art of standing when winds howl."*  

🕶️ **ShadowNet – The Phantom Adversary** grinned in the darkness:  
*"Ignore your crown jewels, and I will steal them first. Focus on the trivial, and I will cut you where it hurts most."*  

The council gathered from across the world:  
- 🌍 **Kwame Okoro**, a risk analyst from Lagos.  
- 🌎 **Sofia Alvarez**, a crisis manager from Buenos Aires.  
- 🌏 **Arjun Mehta**, a strategist from Mumbai.  
- 🌐 **Liam Carter**, a cloud architect from Sydney.

## 📖 The Story Unfolds  

Kwame spoke with gravity:  
*"First, we must know what matters most — our business-critical assets. Without this map, we defend blindly."*  

Sofia added, her eyes sharp:  
*"And once we know them, we must **prioritize threats**. Not every raindrop becomes a flood, but a single crack can sink the ship."*  

Arjun leaned forward:  
*"Resiliency is not only protection. It is designing so that when we fall, we rise again quickly. Redundancy, incident response, backups — these are the ropes that pull us back to our feet."*  

Liam tapped his tablet:  
*"Cloud brings flexibility, but also risk. Our strategy must embrace hybrid protections, threat intelligence, and adaptive controls to keep pace with changing storms."*  

From the shadows, ShadowNet whispered:  
*"Forget resilience, and I will turn one breach into collapse. Fail to prioritize, and I will strike where your eyes do not look."*  

But I.K. spoke softly, like a lantern in the fog:  
*"Identify your crown jewels. Rank the threats. Build your fortress not of walls alone, but of wisdom, readiness, and the will to recover."*  

The council nodded. A plan had formed.

## 📝 Concept Revealed  

### 🔑 The Core Idea  
A security strategy for resiliency means:  
1. **Identify business-critical assets.**  
2. **Prioritize threats** that endanger them most.  
3. **Design controls** to protect, detect, respond, and recover.  

### 🌍 Real-World Lesson  
Organizations must align cybersecurity with **business goals**, ensuring not just protection but continuity — so critical operations survive even under attack.  

### ⚠️ Misunderstandings Broken  
- ❌ **Thinking security = only prevention.** True strategy includes detection and recovery.  
- ❌ **Treating all assets equally.** Not everything is crown-jewel critical.  
- ❌ **Ignoring business goals.** Security without alignment fails to serve the mission.
